In recent years, the most popular games were those which were challenging, but didnâ€™t require long engagement, meaning that you could start and stop playing anytime. This game has been crafted with this idea in mind. So, the player could play a few levels or even only one level than stop and afterwards when he can, continue to play again. Levels can be made easy enough in order to be solvable by children, but it is also possible for the levels to be made difficult enough to simulate older players.

## Gameplay

Each level consists of two parts. In the first part you must navigate through different obstacles, which make the gameplay more exciting, such as catapulting you away from them or return you to the beginning. The particular design of the levels requires fast reflexes and spatial orientation for successful completion.

The actual gameplay starts with the player as a blue square. The goal of this part is to reach the exit portal. Along that path you must watch out not to accidentally collide with obstacles, because if you collide with a red one you will be returned to the beginning, or if you hit a yellow one you will be catapulted in the opposite direction.

Besides the few levels which are currently in the game, I am working on making new and more challenging ones. Moreover I am implementing additional mechanics to the gameplay, which would bring in much more interesting gameplay in further levels. One of those mechanics would be blocks which can teleport you to a different place, other than the beginning. Another would be attractive and repulsive forces i.e. gravity and anti-gravity. This addition would make the game much more challenging and would require the use of the other elements of the game in order to successfully complete the level.

The second part is a puzzle which is essential for unlocking the next level, and is of different type and variation for each level. This, in addition to the first part, which is a spatial puzzle in itself, makes for a gameplay which incorporates old and modern puzzle and game metaphors.

The first screenshot is of the slider puzzle, where you need to make a free path for the red block in order to take it out of the box.

The second screenshot is of the 9-piece puzzle, where you need to arrange the scrambled pieces into a whole picture.
